# Sudoku_Solver

Simple project to create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles. The project was intended to show how difficult it can be to have a computer think as a human as an introduction to AI and Machine Learning. This iteration can solve any puzzle that doesn't require the most advanced techniques, such as Swordfish, XWing, XYWing, and others.
